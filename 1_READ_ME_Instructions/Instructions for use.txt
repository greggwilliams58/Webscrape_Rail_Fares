FORMATTING OF DATA.
This is important as if metadata is in the incorrect format then then application will fail to run.
FORMATTING OF TOC Filter
This item cannot be left blank
If you want no filter, use "All TOCs"
If you want a TOC filter, use the appropriate TOC code.  This can be found via the NRE website, run a search and look for the last two letter at the end of the URL from the returned answer.
(eg show=GW  for GWR from the string https://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/timesandfares/PAD/BRI/today/1145/dep?show=GW)

FORMATTING OF ROUTES
Stations are given in the three letter CRS code, which can be found by running a dummy query for your route on the NRE website (https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/default.aspx)
A comma is used as the separator between origin and destination stations.
Down routes have non-london station first, london station second; up routes are reversed.

FORMATTING OF TIMES:
All times should be in text format, with an Apostrophe at the front to enforce text format.
Times are in HHMM format, with a comma as the separator.
If no times are required, a single comma should be in the cell.  This is required for the running of the application and to serve as an "intentionally blank" placeholder.
